- Hey, y'all! I’m Harvey, aka @hharveyongh
- I have been trying to learn to code for years, but it never stuck. I have some ambitious goals in mind as of 2022. Too ambitious, maybe?
- Right now, I am learning Python, SQL, JS, and C.
- I’m hoping one day I can make something that makes someone's life easier. For now, I'm just looking to learn.

- If you need to reach me for whatever reason, you can email me: harveygit@pm.me

this is a message just for me: hope you're doing ok
